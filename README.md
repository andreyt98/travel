
# Frontend for a fictitious booking hotels and tours page

This was my first project uploaded to Github, my focus at the time was to practice the main concepts of SASS, and responsive web design.
It had a slider made with SwiperJS, until i find out about scroll-snap-type, so i made my own 'native' slider.

Later on, i added more JavaScript, displaying some components dinamically to avoid writing everything on HTML, manipulating the DOM, validating a form and showing some modals.

I'll rebuild it in the future to separate everything into components, and maybe make it a single-page-application, to practice more about JavaScript.
